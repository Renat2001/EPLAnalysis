Analysis of Premier League 2019-2020 season

My project is to analyze data from the English Premier League. As a basis, I took 4 datasets: about the League, players, matches and teams.
Will be considered indicators such as goals scored and conceded, points scored, red cards received, and other football data. 
Also will be considered some game prediction elements.

The datasets are taken from https://footystats.org/download-stats-csv
