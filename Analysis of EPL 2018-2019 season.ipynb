    "# Introduction\n",
    "The English Premier League is a professional football competition held in the United Kingdom. It is attended by 20 English clubs. There are about 580 players participated in EPL from 2018-2019 season.\n",
    "Let's move on to the process of running League games. A table of 20 teams is created in which each of them plays with all the others twice: at their own stadiums(at home) and others'(away).If a team wins a match, it is awarded 3 points, a draw is 1 point, and a loss is 0 points. There are n*(n-1)/2 games in total, which in our case is 190 games. Which team will score the most points in 38 rounds then it will become the winner of the tournament. Also, along with points,other statistics are counted, such as the number of wins, draws, losses, goals scored and conceded, as well as the difference between goals scored and goals conceded. For example, in the 2019-2020 season, Liverpool became the champion with the following statistics: 32 wins, 3 draws, 3 losses, 85 goals and 33 conceded, the difference is 52.\n",

    "# Data description\n",
    "Since football is not only a ball game and it is important not only the final score, after each game is taken detailed statistics of the match, players, how many resultative actions made by a particular player. Based on this observation:\n",
    "+ Bookmakers determine the coefficient for the next games of this team. \n",
    "+ Coaches choose the best starting line-up, knowing the best qualities of the players. \n",
    "+ Sports analysts guess the score of a match based on that data.\n",
    "+ The Premier League compiles complete statistics of the past season, such as the best teams, players, defenders, scorers, assistants and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "My analysis will cover 4 datasets of year 2019. One the main set includes data about players, the size of which is 572 rows. Three additional ones are data about teams that are 20 rows in size, data about league itself - 1 row and all team matches are 380 rows in size. All three form is an overall information about the Premier League.<br>\n",
    "Analysis of the <mark>players</mark> dataset will be based on such indicators as:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "+ position - characterizes the location of the player in the match(such as striker, midfielder, defender, goalkeeper)\n",

    "+ number of goals\n",
    "+ number of assists(pass that led to a goal)\n",
